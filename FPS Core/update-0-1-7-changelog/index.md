Update 0.1.7 is a small update focused on bug fixes. It was released in order to bring critical bug fixes while other larger features were still in development.

It brings fixes for the following two bugs:

- Trying to sprint without an inventory component causes the engine to crash

- Inspect animations were not playing correctly on the weapon mesh

Featuring only bug fixes, v0.1.7 has no changes in functionality, only in stability!
