Update 0.1.6 is here! This is largely a bug fix update for the changes introduced with v0.1.5, which was not QA tested properly before release, a lesson which I'm carrying forward to this and future releases, which should receive much better QA.

## Authoring landing behaviour

The only new 'feature' you'll find in v0.1.6 is the ability to author landing behaviour when sliding is disabled. You'll find the new dropdown in the `Crouch` category, and it's called `Crouch on Landing`.

If this is set to true, the character will crouch on landing (hence the name) if you press the crouch key in mid-air. It's just a way of giving you greater control if you've chosen to disable sliding.

## 'Various bug fixes and improvements'

The all-too common phrase is true here, v0.1.6 features a number of bug fixes from v0.1.5, which you should notice with features like weapon swapping.... actually... well, working :p. I'm so sorry that my QA for v0.1.5 wasn't good enough, and I hope you don't run into any more issues with v0.1.6!

## Migration guide

Being a bug fix update, you should have no issues when updating to v0.1.6, just an increase in stability!
